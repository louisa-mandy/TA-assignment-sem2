The code that I've created consist of Inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism
I have made a superclass that is for the animal class.
Also the subclass that is for the dog, chicken, and spider class

Inside the Animal class:
There is the polymorphism part where it would print out the sound (no sound) , only for the spider class. Because spider does not produce any sounds

Inside the dog, chicken, and spider class
Each of the animal name classes would extend the animal class ( superclass ), which is the inheritance part of the code.
The polymorphism part of the code exists inside of the dog and chicken class, but not the spider class. Because only dogs and chickens would produce sounds. 

Encapsulation part of the code:
This part exists inside the main class, which consist of the private animal classes (animal1, animal2, and animal3)
The private class would then be accessed by making it a public void ( starting from line 55 )
The names of each animal class would now be printed out in the output, as such:  

Output:
The code would print all of the animal classes, including Dog, Chicken, and Spider. Each of these classes would print out the name of the animal - the sound that the animal makes - Type of animal - and how many legs it has.
